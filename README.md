# What is the MASS community ?
The MASS community is an open, non-profit online organisation whose mission is to promote blockchain technology among the wider public, thereby improving peopleâ€™s lives and leading to a fairer and more prosperous society.

The MASS community was launched in 2017 by Dr. Ren Ling. We are constantly furthering our development through continuous online discussion and cooperation, as well as periodic offline events. The MASS community welcomes all experts with backgrounds in computer science, social sciences, economics, finance, or entrepreneurship, and who have the same aims as us. We prefer members with original insights and strong collaboration skills. In order to ensure community members are sufficiently qualified, new members must be first approved by at least half of the existing members. The MASS community has strict requirements for research and implementation to ensure the excellence of our work. When the time is right, our work will be made open source, a move which will promote wider awareness of the technology and will aid with future collaboration.

Those who wish to join the MASS community are welcome to send their CV to community@massnet.org, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
